								<h2><i>Today's Scripture</i></h2>
								<blockquote>And now I have told you before it comes, that when it does come to pass, you may believe -John 14:29</blockquote>
								
								<p>There is an old Chinese proverb that speaks of the value of preparation, saying "thatch your roof before rainy weather; dig your well before you become parched with thirst." Even the unbelievers in this world understand the value of being prepared. A surgeon does not study a text to learn the human anatomy while in the middle of an operation. A pilot does not learn the mechanics of an aircraft while in flight. In each of these examples, adequate preparation is essential. So, if the unbelieving world understands the value of peparation, how much more should we use the Word of God to prepare our hearts for anything we may encounter in this life?</p>
								
								<h3>Use his word to establish your heart, before you find yourself in a time of need.</h3>
								
								<p>Many believers, though they may value the Word of God, have not understood how to use the Word to prepare their heart. For instance, they wait until they are sick before they study Scriptures that speak of healing. In other cases, they wait until they are troubled and full of turmoil in their heart before they meditate on Scriptures that speak of the Divine Peace. Use his word to establish your heart, before you find yourself in a time of need. Don't wait until your back is against the wall! Meditate on healing Scriptures while you are well, so that when your body tries to succumb to infirmity, your heart already has a firm foundation of faith to resist any sickness or disease. Study verses on abundance so that you will expect to prosper even in the land of lack. Ponder on verses that speak of Divine Protection so that you are confident even in perilous times.</p>
								
								<p>Having said this, what should you do if you are already in a place of need, and your heart is unprepared? If you find yourself unprepared in a time of need, take heart! God is merciful, and He will remain your ever-present help even when you are unprepared. You can still trust Him to walk you through the fire unscathed. But imagine how much greater it would be to establish your heart with the Word of God beforehand, so that when circumstances arise, you do not have to search for answers, because your heart already knows which truth to apply.</p>
								
								<p>Jesus revealed the value of being prepared by the Word when He spoke to His disciples in John 14:29, saying "And now I have told you before it comes, that when it does come to pass, you may believe" [NKJV]. Just as the Lord wanted His Disciples to be prepared for whatever circumstances may have arisen, He desires the same for us today. Moreover, He has given us His written Word, which is more than enough for us to stand fully prepared and fully equipped. </p>
								
								<p>Rest assured that He has already foreseen every possible circumstance you could ever face, and He has already given you the answer for it in His Word. Since you don't know what circumstances or needs you may encounter, study His Word to be prepared for whatever this fallen world may present you. It's never too early to start, and it's never too late to start. There's no better time to start than now!</p>
								
											
															
								<h2><i>Today's Prayer</i></h2>
								<blockquote>Father, I don't want to put my trust in man or my self-efforts. I choose to put my trust in You and Your unmerited favor. Help me to depend on and see Your goodness and grace toward me every day, so that I can experience Your good success without the stress. I thank you that one moment of Your unmerited favor can cause me to experience accelerated blessings and promotion that years of striving and struggling can never achieve.</blockquote>
								
								<h2>Today's Thought</h2>
								<blockquote>God has given us His written Word, which is more than enough for us to stand fully prepared and fully equipped!</blockquote>
								
								<h2>let's discuss</h2>
								
								<ol>
									<li>Read the opening scripture (John 14:29). Why is it important for us to prepare and establish our hearts before we find ourselves in a place of need?</li>
									
									<li>Read <strong>Psalm 46:1</strong> and <strong>Hebrews 4:16</strong>. If we find ourselves in a place of need, and we are unprepared, can we still trust God to be our help and to give us Mercy and Grace? Why?</li>
									
									<li>Can you think of some verses of Scripture that can prepare your heart in the area of healing?</li>
									
									<li>Can you think of some Scriptures that can prepare your heart in the area of Divine Peace?</li>
								</ol>
