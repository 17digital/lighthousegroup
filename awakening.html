								<h2>Ice Breaker</h2>
								<blockquote>Do you have a comical (brief) “wake up” story that you could share with the group &#8212;perhaps when someone woke you up with a prank, or maybe when a loud noise woke you? Or else, maybe you could share a sleep-talking experience.</blockquote>
								
								<p><strong>Opening Thought:</strong> Think of times when you have dreamt while sleeping. In your dream, your subconscious mind led you to believe that you were awake. But once you awoke from sleep, your were suddenly struck with the awareness that you had been dreaming all along.  Likewise, many believers in the Body of Christ today are convinced that they are “awake,” when in fact they are caught up in the natural realm, completely unaware of what is happening in the Spirit.</p>

								<p>In the New Testament epistles, we find a call for the believer to awaken from sleep. Mundane life has a way of lulling us to sleep, in spiritual terms. Sure, we are spiritually alive, but often we walk as though we were oblivious to what is happening in the spirit realm. If your life has been wrapped up in the matters of this natural world, it is time for you to wake up!</p>
								
								<h3>Awaken to Righteousness; awaken to who you are in Christ! Awaken to discern the season that the Body of Christ is in right now.</h3>
								
								<p>As believers, we are certainly called to rest, but there is a difference between rest and slumber! It is possible to rest and progress at the same time, but one who slumbers will grow stagnant. Continue to rest in Him, but awaken from your slumber. Such an awakening is essential, as all signs seem to indicate that we are in the “homestretch,” approaching the Lord’s return. Whether His return is tomorrow or centuries from now, wake up, be alert, and live ready!</p>
								
								<h2><i>Opening Scripture</i></h2>
								<blockquote>“And do this, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed”&#8212;Romans 13:11[NKJV]</blockquote>
								
								<h2>Discuss</h2>
								<ol>
									<li>Read the Opening Scripture (Romans 13:11).  What do you believe it means to “awake out of sleep” in spiritual terms?</li>
									<li>Read Ephesians <strong>5:14-16</strong>.  Many believers have been lulled to sleep by the mundane matters of this life.  Why is it essential that we as believers awaken to Spiritual reality?</li>
									<li>According to Scripture, we are called to REST IN HIM <em><u>always</u></em>, but we are called to awaken from slumber. How would you describe the difference between <em>rest</em> and <em>slumber</em>?</li>
									<li>Read <strong>I Corinthians 15:34</strong>. What does it mean to “awake to Righteousness”</li>
									<li>[Referring back to <em><u>opening verse</u></em> above] Note that Romans 13:11 says “knowing the time.” Why is it important for us to be able to discern the season that the Body of Christ is in currently?</li>
								
								</ol>
								
								
								
															
								<h2>Invitation</h2>
								<blockquote>According to <strong>Psalm 17:15</strong> the first thing you see when you “awaken” is a revelation of His likeness.  Think for a moment and you will understand the logic of this passage.  When someone wakes you out of a deep sleep, the first thing you see is the person who woke you up.  Right now, God is gently nudging you, to wake you from your sleep.  If you will yield and respond to His call, the first thing you will experience is a revelation of Who He is!  If you listen carefully, your heart will hear His still, small Voice calling you to awaken.  Respond to that gentle call today!</blockquote>
