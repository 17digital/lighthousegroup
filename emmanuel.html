								<p><strong>Opening Thought:</strong> In the first chapter of Matthew’s Gospel, Matthew quoted from Isaiah chapter seven as a reference to the birth of JESUS, saying: “Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel,” which is translated, “God with us” (Matt 1:23, NKJV). One of the names of JESUS is Emmanuel, which is to say “GOD with us.” </p>
								
								<p>The birth of JESUS represented the most unique moment in all of human history, in which GOD Almighty took on flesh.  Colossians 2:9 affirms that in CHRIST dwells all of the fullness of the GODHEAD bodily.  When JESUS was born, all of the fullness of GOD was wrapped into the package of a newborn Baby. When He came in the Flesh, suddenly GOD was with us.  What an amazing reality!  JESUS longed to be with us, and to have us with HIM. Coming to dwell among us, in fact, was a means to an end for HIM.  HE came and dwelt among us and related to us, so that we could relate to HIM and join HIM where HE is! While it is true that HE willingly lowered HIMSELF to our level (Phil 2:7), HIS ultimate purpose for coming was to exalt us to HIS level.  HE even told the Father, in John 17, “Father, I desire that they also whom You gave Me may be with Me where I am” (John 17:24, NKJV).</p>
								
								<p>But before we could join Him where He is, He had to join us where we are.  He, first, had to join us, in our hurts, pains, temptations, frailties, and even in our death.  When all seemed hopeless, CHRIST stepped in, and HE brought victory and hope with HIM!  Even today, HE is our Emmanuel.  Why?  Recall that Emmanuel is more than a mere description of who HE is; “Emmanuel” is part of HIS name!  When HE ascended to Heaven, HE did not change HIS Name. HE remains Emmanuel, the Lord ever present with us.  He promised that HE would be with us always (Matt 28:20). Look to your Emmanuel today, HE is right there with you, and better still, HE has lifted you up to where HE is!</p>

								<h2><i>Opening Scripture</i></h2>
								<blockquote><strong>Matt 1:22-23&#8212;</strong> “<strong>22</strong> So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying: <strong>23</strong> “Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,” which is translated, “God with us.”</blockquote>
								
								
								<h2>Discuss</h2>
								<ol class="discuss">
									<li>Read opening Sripture <strong>Matt 1:22-23</strong>. Why is it significant that “Emmanuel” is not merely a description of CHRIST, but rather part of HIS Name?</li>
									
									<li>Read <strong>John 17:24</strong>. What desire does JESUS express to the FATHER here concerning you?</li>
									
									<li>Read <strong>John 14:18</strong>. What does JESUS mean when HE promised that HE would not leave us as orphans?</li>
									
									<li>Read <strong>Matt 28:20</strong>. What type of assurance or confidence can the believer have through the Promise given in this passage?</li>
									
									<li>Read <strong>Hebrews 13:5</strong>. Why does HIS promise to never leave us produce contentment within us? </li>
									
								
								
								</ol>
								
								
								
									
								<h2>Invitation</h2>
								<blockquote>During this CHRISTMAS season, seek to know and be aware of JESUS as your Emmanuel.  HE wants to be with you!</blockquote>
