								<h2><i>Today's Scripture</i></h2>
								<blockquote>You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near to me, you and your children, your children's children, your flocks, and your herds, and all that you have. There I will provide for you, lest you and your household, and all that you have, come to poverty; for there are still five years of famine. &#8212;Genesis 45:10-11</blockquote>
								
								<p>In the Old Testament story of Joseph, after Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, he tells them to return to their father and to tell him, "...come down to me, do not tarry. You shall dwell in the land of <strong>Goshen</strong>, and you shall be <strong>near to me</strong>, you and your children, your children's children, your flocks and your herds, and all that you have." (Gensis 45:9-10) The name "Goshen" means "drawing near." God wants you to be in "Goshen," which is a place of nearness to Him, and there is no place nearer to Him than being in the Beloved. God's heart of love is not satisfied with just removing your sins from you. No, He wants more. He wants you in His presence. He wants you in the place where He can lavish the bountiful love in His heart on you!</p>
								
								<h3>Remember that as God's beloved child, you are in the world, but not of this world.</h3>
								
								<p>When you draw near to Jesus, look what happens. Joseph tells his brothers to also tell their father, "<strong>There I will provide for you</strong>, lest you and your household, and all that you have, come to poverty; for there are still five years of famine." When you draw near to your heavenly Joseph, He will provide for you and your little ones. In the midst of financial famine in the world, in the midst of rising fuel and food costs, do not despair. Draw near to Jesus, for there in "Goshen," in that place of nearness, He will provide for you and your household. Your God shall supply ALL your needs according to HIS riches (not according to your bank account balance or to the world's economic situation) in glory by Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:19)!</p>
								
								<p>That's not all, my friend. Another blessing that you can enjoy when you are in the Beloved is divine protection. In recent years, new strains of deadly viruses have been making headlines. But whatever the virus may be, whether it's the bird flu or swine flu or some other new plague, you can safely claim Psalm 91 for yourself. You can declare, "A thousand may fall at my side, and ten thousand at my right hand; but it shall <strong>not</strong> come near me, God's beloved!" (Psalm 91:7).</p>
								
								<p>When there were plagues and pestilences all over Egypt because Pharaoh refused to let God's people go, look at what God said about the children of Israel: "...I will <strong>set apart</strong> the land of Goshen, in which My people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there, in order that you may know that I am the Lord in the midst of the land. I will <strong>make a difference</strong> between My people and your people..." (Exodus 8:22-23). There is a difference between God's beloved people and the people of the world. Although Egypt was plagued by swarms of flies and other pestilences, the children of Israel were safe in the land of Goshen, completely untouched by the troubles!</p>
								
								<p>So even if there are bad things happening in the world today, remember that as God's beloved child, you are <strong>in</strong> the world, but not <strong>of</strong> the world (John 17:11, 16). No plague, no evil and no danger can come close to you and your dwelling place because you are safe in the secret place of the Most High. As the children of Israel were kept safe and protected in Goshen, so will you and I, whome God calls His beloved!</p>
								
															
								<h2><i>Today's Prayer</i></h2>
								<blockquote>Father, I thank You that You protect, deliver and provide for my family and me because I am in Christ Your Beloved. I thank You for Jesus and Your unmerited favor, and for making a difference between Your people and the people of the world. Today, as I go about my activities, I will fear no evil because I am Your beloved child enjoying divine protection and provision!</blockquote>
								
								<h2>Today's Thought</h2>
								<blockquote>I am different from the people of the world&#8212;I have a God who looks after me!</blockquote>
