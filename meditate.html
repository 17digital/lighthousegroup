								<h2><i>Psalm 91:1-16 Amp</i></h2>
								<ol>
									<li>He who dwells in the shelter of the most high Will remain secure and rest in the shadow of the almighty [whose power no enemy can withstand].</li>
									<li>I will say of the Lord, "He is my refuge and my fortress, My God, in whom I trust [with great confidence, and on whome I rely]!"</li>
									<li>For He will save you from the trap of the fowler, and from the deadly pestilence.</li>
									<li>He will cover you and completely protect you with his pinions, and under His wings you will find refuge; His faithfullness is a shield and wall.</li>
									<li>You will not be afraid of the terror of night, nor of the arrow that flies by day,</li>
									<li>Nor of the pestilence that stalks in darkness, nor of the destruction (sudden death) that lays waste at noon.</li>
									<li>A thousand may fall at your side and ten thousand at your right hand, but danger will not come near you.</li>
									<li>You will only [be a spectator as you] look on with your eyes and witness the [divine] repayment of the wicked [as you watch safetly from the shelter of the Most High].</li>
									<li>Because you have made the Lord, [who is] my refuge, even the Most High, your dwelling place,</li>
									<li>No evil will befall you, nor will any plague come near your tent.</li>
									<li>For He will command His Angels in regard to you, To protect and defend and guard you in all your ways [of obedience and service].</li>
									<li>They will lift you up in their hands, so that you do not [even] strike your foot against a stone.</li>
									<li>You will tread upon the lion and cobra; the young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot.</li>
									<li>Because he set his Love on Me, therefore I will save him; I will set him [securely] on high, because he knows my name [He confidently trust and relies on me, knowing I will never abandon him, No, Never].</li>
									<li>He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him and honor him</li>
									<li>With a long life I will satisfy him and I will let him see my salvation</li>
								</ol>
								
								<h2><i>Philippians 4:4-9 Amp</i></h2>
								<ol start="4">
									<li>Rejoice in the Lord always [delight, take pleasure in Him]; again I will say, rejoice!</li>
									<li>Let your gentle spirit [your graciousness, unselfishness, mercy, tolerance, and patience] be known to all people. <strong>The Lord is near</strong>.</li>
									<li>Do not be anxious or worried about anything, but in everything [every circumstance and situation] by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, continue to make your [specific] requests know to God.</li>
									<li>And the peace of God [that peace which reassures the heart, that peace] which transcends all understanding, [that peace which] stands guard over your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus [is yours].</li>
									<li>Finally, <strong>believers</strong>, whatever is true, whatever is honorable and worthy of respect, whatever is right and confirmed by God's Word, whatever is pure and wholesome, whatever is lovely and brings peace, whatever is admirable and of good repute; if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, <mark>think continually</mark> on these things [center your mind on them, and implant them in your heart].</li>
									
									<li>The things which you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things [in daily life], and the God [who is the source] of peace and well-being will be with you.</li>
								</ol>
								
								<h2><i>Psalm 23:1-6 Amp</i></h2>
								<ol>
									<li>The Lord is my Shepherd [to feed, to guide and to shield me], I shall not want.</li>
									<li>He lets me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside the still and quiet waters.</li>
									<li>He refreshes and restores my soul (life); He leads me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake</li>
									<li>Even though I walk through the [sunless] valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod [to protect] and Your staff [to guide], they comfort and console me.</li>
									<li>&#9733;<mark>You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies</mark>. You have anointed and refreshed my head with oil; My cup overflows.</li>
									<li>Surely goodness and mercy and unfailing love shall follow me all the days of my life, And I shall dwell forever [throughout all my days] in the house and in the presence of the Lord.</li>
								</ol>
								
								<h2><em>Proverbs 3:13-18</em></h2>
								<ol start="13">
									<li>Happy is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gains understanding</li>
									<li>For Her proceeds are better than the profits of silver, and Her gain than fine gold</li>
									<li>She is more precious than rubies and all the things you may desire cannot compare with Her</li>
									<li>Length of days is in Her right hand, in Her left hand riches and honor.</li>
									<li>Her ways are ways of pleasanteness and all Her paths are Peace</li>
									<li>She is a tree of Life to those who take hold of Her, and Happy are all who retain Her</li>
								</ol>
								
								<h2><em>Romans 8:32</em></h2>
								<ol start="32">
									<li>He who did not spare even His own Son, but gave Him up for us all, how will He not also, along with Him, graciously give us all things?</li>
								</ol>
								
								<h2><em>Psalm 110:1-2</em></h2>
								<ol>
									<li>The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool."</li>
									<li>The Lord shall send the rod of Your strength out of Zion. Rule in the midst of Your enemies!
								</ol>
													
				
								<h2><i>Today's Prayer</i></h2>
								<blockquote>Father, I thank you that the blood of your son Jesus has put an end to sin and given me everlasting righteousness! And because I have the gift of everlasting righteousness that is not dependent on my works, my fellowship with you cannot be broken even when I mess up. I can still come to you boldly to receive grace and help. How can I not be victorious in life with your grace and help!</blockquote>
