								<h2><i>Today's Scripture</i></h2>
								<blockquote>Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit <em>who is</em> in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?&#8212;1 Corinthians 6:19</blockquote>
								
								<h2>Opening Thought</h2>
								
								<p>In the Matthew 21, we find an account in which Jesus entered the Temple and drove out the moneychangers and merchants. Though Jesus is loving and compassionate, when it came to cleansing the Temple, He was firm. In fact, John's account of the same event says that Jesus even made a whip of cords to drive out the merchants. Why did Jesus take such measures to cleanse the Temple? According to Scripture, Jesus had a zeal for the Temple of His Father and would not see it become a "den of thieves" [Matt 21:13, NKJV]. Thieves must be driven out of the Temple.</p>
								
								<h3>Consider that statement carefully. Now ask yourself this question: what is the Temple of God?</h3>
								
								<p>The Apostle Paul wrote in 1st Corinthians 6:19 that our body is the Temple of the Holy Spirit. Did you know that thieves also try to enter the Temple of your body? Sickness and disease are thieves. Cancer is a thief. Pain is a thief. Your body is the Temple of the Holy Spirit, and thieves have no place in your Temple. How do you deal with thieves in the Temple?</p>
								
								<p>Consider this: when Jesus saw the moneychangers in His Father's House, He responded with authority, not passively. Imagine if Jesus had responded to the moneychangers and merchants by saying "Well, this is God's House, and if they are here it is because God allowed it." When Jesus saw the thieves trespassing, He did not allow it! You must have the same resolve with the Temple of your Body. Unfortunately, many people respond to sickness and infirmity in their body by saying, "God must have allowed it for a reason." If Jesus had responded in such a manner to the moneychangers, they never would have left the Temple, and likely more would have come.</p>
								
								<p>Thieves can only stay in a Temple if the one with authority allows it. Who is the one with authority? According to Luke 10:19, the Lord gave <em>you</em> the authority! Use your authority! Don't simply say, "God must have a reason for allowing this sickness." The truth is, you have allowed it! The Lord has given you authority, and now it is up to you to take your God&#8212;given authority and drive the thieves out of the Temple.</p>
								
								<p>We must be careful to draw our doctrine from the Scripture and not from traditions of men. Jesus was a perfect image of His Father. Of all the times that people came to Jesus for healing, do we ever hear Him respond by saying, "not just yet; there is still much for you to learn first?" Of course He never responded in that way. God does not use sickness to teach us, and God is not the one who allows it. Rather, God is the One Who has given you the solution. Jesus purchased your healing at the Cross. Now it is up to you to claim it and to drive away the thieves from your temple.</p>
								
																				
								<h2>Discuss</h2>
								<ol>
									<li>Read the opening Scripture (1 Cor 6:19). Our body is the Temple of the Holy Spirit. Based on this truth, discuss the following statement as a group: <em>Our physical healing is important to GOD, and therefore it should be just as important to us. HE paid for it, and we ought to receive it.</em></li>
									
									<li>Read <strong>Matthew 9:1-8</strong> and <strong>Psalm 103:2-3</strong>. Notice how the Lord puts forgiveness of sin and physical healing into the same context. People who feel undeserving or unworthy will struggle to receive their physical healing. <em>How does receiving His forgiveness help us to receive Healing?</em></li>
									
									<li>Read <strong>1 Peter 2:24</strong> and <strong>Isaiah 53:5.</strong> Why is it important to know that JESUS paid for our forgiveness and our healing at the same time?</li>
									
									<li>Read <strong>Psalm 107:20, Hebrews 4:12,</strong> and <strong>Romans 8:11</strong>. Note that each verse speaks of our physical body (even Hebrews 4:12 speaks of the joints and marrow). <em>What role do the Spirit and the Word have in ministering healing to us?</em></li>
									
									<li>Read <strong>Luke 10:19.</strong> This verse says that He has given us authority. Wit that truth in mind, how should we respond when thieves try to invade the Temple of our body?</em></li>
								
								</ol>
								
								<h2>Invitation</h2>
