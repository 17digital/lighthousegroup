								<h2><i>Today's Scripture</i></h2>
								<blockquote>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, "Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree"), that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&#8212;Galations 3:13-14</blockquote>
								
								<p>God's blessings are part of our inheritance in the new covenant of grace, which Jesus died to give us. God's Word tells us that "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us... that <strong>the blessing of Abraham</strong> might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith." Isn't it interesting that the Lord is very specific in mentioning that Christ became a curse for us on the cross, so that we can experience and enjoy the blessing of Abraham? He does not want us to simply experience any kind of blessing. He wants us to experience <strong>the blessings of Abraham.</strong> I think it behooves us then to find out what "the blessing of Abraham" is and who can receive it.</p>
								
								<h3>Every believer in Christ is an heir. "Heir" speaks of an inheritance that is yours not because of what you do, but because of whose you are.</h3>
								
								<p>The Bible tells us that "if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise" (Galations 3:29). Are you Christ's? Do you belong to Jesus? Then that makes you an heir <strong>according to the promise.</strong> Every believer in Christ is an heir. Whenever you hear the word "heir," it speaks of something good. It speaks of an inheritance that you don't work for, an inheritance that is yours not because of what you do, but because of <strong>whose</strong> you are. In this case, as a new covenant believer in Jesus, you belong to Jesus and you have a blood-bought inheritance in Christ as the seed of Abraham. You, beloved, are an heir according to THE promise!</p>
								
								<p>Now, there are many promises in the Bible, but what is THE promise that God made to Abraham? We can't claim this promise if we don't know what it is. We need to go to the Word (use the Bible to interpret the Bible) to establish what the promise is. And we find the answer in Romans 4:13&#8212;"For <strong>the promise</strong> that he would be the <strong>heir of the world</strong> was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law, but through the righteousness of faith."</p>
								
								<p>The promise of Abraham and his seed (you and I) is that he would be "the heir of the world"! In the original Greek text, the word "world" here is <em>kosmos</em>. Its meaning includes, "the whole cirlce of earthly goods, endowments, riches, advantages, pleasures." Now, <strong>that</strong> is what you are an heir to through Jesus' finished work! In Christ, you are an heir of the world&#8212;its goods, its endowments, its riches, its advantages, and its pleasures. This is THE promise that God made to Abraham and his seed. Don't apologize for it. It is your inheritance in Christ!</p>
								
															
															
								<h2><i>Today's Prayer</i></h2>
								<blockquote>Father, I thank You that I am an heir of the world because I am Abraham's seed through Christ. I have such a rich inheritance not because I have done anything to deserve it, but because Jesus qualified me through his death and resurrection. And since Jesus died to give me this wonderful inheritance, I will not apologize for it, but expect to experience and enjoy it!</blockquote>
								
								<h2>Today's Thought</h2>
								<blockquote>I am an heir of the world through Jesus' finished work!</blockquote>
