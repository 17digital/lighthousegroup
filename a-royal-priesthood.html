								<h2><i>Today's Scripture</i></h2>
								<blockquote>And they sang a new song, saying: "You are worthy to take the scroll, and to open its seals; for You were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your Blood out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and have made us kings and priests to our God; And we shall reign on the earth."&#8212;Revelation 5:9-10</blockquote>
								
								<p><strong>Opening Thought:</strong> If you are a follower of Christ, then according to 1 Peter 2:9, you have become a "royal priesthood." What is a royal priesthood? In order to understand this terminology, and its implications concerning your position in Christ, consider the meaning of each word. "Royal" implies kingship, or royalty. "Priesthood" speaks of being a priest before God. When you came into Christ, He conferred upon you the role of <em>both</em> king and priest.
								
								Some have taught that you are either a king or a priest in Christ, but Revelation 5:9-10 clearly states that He has "made us kings <strong>and</strong> priests to our God" [NKJV].</p>
								
								<h3>For this reason we are called a "Royal Priesthood," because He has made us royalty and established us as a priesthood.</h3>
								
								<p>Why would we want to be <em>both</em> kings and priests? In the Old Covenant, the roles of king and priest were very distinct, and one could not serve as both (with the exception of Melchizedek, who lived before the Law). Each role had distinct capacities which only applied to that particular role. A king was able to make decrees with authority, while a priest did not have the authority to make such decrees. Priests, however, held the right to apply the blood of sacrifice&#8212;a privilege that was not afforded to kings. But in Christ, you now walk as both King and Priest!</p>
								
								<p>Therefore, as a king you have the right to make decrees by the authority of the Word of God, and as priest you have the right to apply the Blood of His Sacrifice to every area of need in your life. When you begin to understand your position in Christ, you will start to walk with greater confidence in your authority as a believer. You are a King and a priest in Christ&#8212;a Royal Priesthood! Begin to walk accordingly. Because you are royalty in Him, it is time for you to make decrees on the authority of His Word. Because you are a priesthood in Him, it is time for you to apply the Blood of Jesus to every area of your life. Take up the role that Jesus has conferred upon you, and begin to walk as a royal priesthood today!</p>
								
																				
								<h2>Discuss</h2>
								<ol>
									<li>Read the opening Scripture [Revelation 5:9-10]. What do you believe it means to be called kings and priests to our God?</li>
									<li>Read <strong>1 Peter 2:9.</strong> What does it mean to be a royal priesthood?</li>
									<li>As a king, you have the right to make decrees based on the authority of the Word of God. According to <strong>Romans 10:8,</strong> "the Word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart" [NKJV]. <em><u>Why is it important for the Word of God to be both in our mouth and in our heart?</u></em></li>
									<li>Read <strong>II Corinthians 4:13.</strong> What happens when we truly believe the Word and speak it?</li>
									<li>Read <strong>Ephesians 2:13 and Colossians 1:14.</strong> Under the Law, it was the priest that had the right to apply the blood of the sacrifice. As a priesthood in Christ, we have the right to apply the Blood of His Sacrifice in our lives, in the areas of health, protection, provision, family, peace, etc...<em><u>As a believer what does it mean to you know that you have the right to apply the Blood of His Sacrifice?</u></em></li>
