								<h2><i>Today's Scripture</i></h2>
								<blockquote>I will make you a great nation; I will bless you and make your name great; and you shall be a blessing.&#8212;Genesis 12:2</blockquote>
								
								<p>What does it mean to be an heir of the world? Let's take a look at Abraham's life to see what the Lord did for him. God's Word tells us that Abraham did not just become rich. He became very rich.</p>
								
								<h3>The success that we, as new covenant believers, can believe God for is good, holistic success that permeates every aspect of our lives!</h3>
								
								<p><em>"Well, Pastor Prince, being an heir of the world refers to spiritual riches."</em></p>
								
								<p>Hang on, that is not what my Bible says. According to Genesis 13:2, Abraham was "very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold." Now, if financial blessings are not part of the blessings of the Lord, then are you telling me that the Lord cursed Abraham with wealth? I am so glad that God defined Abraham's riches very specifically. God must have foreseen a generation of people who would argue that He is against His people experiencing financial success, so He said clearly in His Word that Abraham was very rich in livestock, silver and gold. Abraham wasn't just rich spiritually. Beloved, God is not against you having wealth, but He is definitely against wealth having you.</p>
								
								<p>The Lord blessed Abraham so that he could be a blessing to others. He told Abraham, "...I will bless you...and you shall be a blessing." Similarly, He will bless you financially, so that <strong>you</strong> can be a blessing to others. You cannot be a blessing to those around you&#8212;your loved ones, local church, community, and the poor&#8212;if you are not blessed by the Lord first.</p>
								
								<p>Now, you already know that finances alone don't make you a success. There are a lot of "poor" people in the world today who have a lot of money. They can have fat bank accounts, but their hearts are empty without the revelation of Jesus' love for them. You and I have something from Jesus that is far more superior. The success that we, as new covenant believers, can believe God for is good, holistic success that permeates every aspect of our lives.</p>
								
								<p>What keeps you safe for financial success is when you know that your blessings come by Jesus' unmerited favor. When you have that revelation, you will no longer be preoccupied with having money because you will be preoccupied with the Lord. Amazingly, you will realize that the more occupied you are with Jesus, the more money follows after you! Now, why is that? It is simply because when you seek first the kingdom of God, and put Jesus, His righteousness (not your own righteousness), His joy and His peace as your first priority, God's Word promises you that ALL the material things that you need will be added to you (Mattew 6:33).</p>
								
								<p>The Lord always gives you money with a mission and prosperity with a purpose. He blesses you and when you are blessed, you can be a vessel to bless others. The gospel of grace can be preached, churches can be built, precious lives can be touched, sinners can be born again, marriages can be restored and physical bodies can be healed when you send out the Word of Jesus with your financial support.</p>
								
								<p>Don't love money and use people. Use money to love people. May it be settled in your heart once and for all that it is God's desire for you to be a financial success and to have more than enough to bless others!</p>
								
															
								<h2><i>Today's Prayer</i></h2>
								<blockquote>Father, I thank You that Your blessings for me include financial prosperity. I know that You are not against me having money, but You don't want money to keep me in bondage. I ask that You prosper me financially, so that I may use money for Your kingdom work and to bless those in need. Keep me safe for financial success. Help me keep my eyes on Jesus&#8212;always preoccupied with Him and His purposes, and never forgetting that every blessing comes by Your unmerited favor.</blockquote>
								
								<h2>Today's Thought</h2>
								<blockquote>Don't love money and use people. Use money to love people.</blockquote>
