								<h2><i>Today's Scripture</i></h2>
								<blockquote>...casting all your cares upon Him, for He cares for you -1 Peter 5:7</blockquote>
								
								<p>Discouragment can be a powerful force, especially when the circumstances in your life present strong opposition. How can you overcome emotions of discouragment? In the book of 1 Samuel, chapter 30, David was faced with a devastating conflict that could have left him beyond discouraged. A group of people called the Amlekites attacked David's men at Ziklag, and after they burned everything with fire, they took the women and children captive. As a result, David's men spoke of stoning him.</p>
								
								<h3>Praise him and thank him until your heart begins to think of jesus instead of the problem!</h3>
								
								<p>But 1 Samuel 30:6 says that David strengthened himself in the <strong>Lord</strong>. Some translations say that he <strong>encouraged</strong> himself in the <strong>Lord</strong>. Later, everything was recovered, including all of the women and children. Did you realize that you have this same ability to encourage yourself in the Lord, even in times when circumstances are agains you? </p>
								
								<p>First, you must realize that discouragement is not a setback or a defeat in your life. Everyone in this life has the opportunity to grow weary or discouraged. The simple fact that you are discouraged does <strong>NOT</strong> mean that you are defeated. When you are discouraged, you have not lost ground; you have simply lost focus.</p>
								
								<p>How do you regain focus? You will begin to regain your focus when you understand that there was already a solution to your problem before you were even aware that your problem existed. This is one of the greatest truths about living life in Christ. Jesus always supplies the answer to every need before the need ever exists. Regardless of the nature of the problem you are facing, whether it is in your health, in your emotions, in your family, in your finances, or in your job, there is already a solution. Why? Because a discouraged heart has occupied itself only with the problem, and therefore, a discouraged heart is unable to recognize the solution.</p>
								
								<p>Before you discover the solution, you must first bring your heart out of that place of discouragement. Begin to look for Jesus in the middle of those circustances. If it is difficult for you to see Him, then simply put your problems off to the side and begin to praise Him. Praise Him and thank Him until your heart begins to think of Jesus instead of the problem. When you do this, you are casting your cares upon the Lord. Notice from 1 Samuel 30 that David did not find his solution until after he encouraged himself in the Lord. The same will be true in your circustances.</p>
								
								<p>After you begin to encourage your heart by looking to Jesus, then your heart will be prepared to discover the solution that Jesus had already provided. Speak to your own heart if you must. David had to talk to his own soul in Psalm 116:7, where he says, "<i>Return to your rest, O my soul, for the Lord has dealt bountifully with you."</i> Sometimes you will have to tell your own soul to return to rest. Encourage yourself; edify yourself. Jude 1:20 says that when you pray in the Holy Spirit, you build yourself up in your most Holy faith. When life tries to tear you down, begin to build yourself back up; you will not be shaken if you are built upon that solid rock which is Christ. If you wait for your circumstances to improve before you become encouraged, then you still stay in your current situation. But if you encourage your heart now, in Christ, then you will begin to find your way into victory!</p>
								
															
								<h2><i>Today's Prayer</i></h2>
								<blockquote>Father, I thank you that in the midst of any crisis, I can take refuge in the shadow of Your wings and have Your peace. My trust is in You and I thank You that You will protect and deliver me and all my loved ones no matter what is raging around us.</blockquote>
								
								<h2>Today's Thought</h2>
								<blockquote>When you encourage your heart now, in Christ, then you will begin to find your way into Victory!</blockquote>
