								<p><strong>Opening Thought:</strong> All of us have encountered some degree of fear in our lives.   For some people, fear simply shows up in the form of worry and anxiety in everyday life. Others live with a perpetual dread that is constantly nagging and tormenting them.  So how do we break the power of fear in our lives?  First, we must establish what fear is.  Fear is more than a mere emotion.</p>

								<p>The BIBLE teaches that fear is a spiritual force, saying in 2nd Timothy 1:7 that GOD has not given us a “spirit of fear.”  Simply put, fear can be defined as a spiritual force that tries to influence your expectations in a negative way.  If you have been struggling with fear, JESUS wants to redefine your expectations through HIS infinite Love.  According to 1st John 4:18, “he who fears has not been made perfect in Love” [NKJV].  The same verse adds that “perfect love casts out fear.” So, if you are battling fear in your life, consider the perfection of HIS LOVE toward you.</p>
								
								<p>Consider this picture: when a child is afraid in the middle of the night, he runs to his mother or father to calm and settle that fear.  GOD has called you HIS child, which is one of the greatest measures of Love HE could give you, just as 1st John 3:1 affirms, saying “behold what manner of love the FATHER has bestowed on us that we should be called children of GOD.”  If you are a child of GOD, then you can run to your Daddy in Heaven to calm and settle any fear.  Did you know that the BIBLE teaches that the Spirit of Adoption is the opposite of the spirit of fear?  In Romans 8:15, the Apostle Paul wrote, “For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, ‘Abba, Father’” [NKJV].</p>
								
								<p>Clearly, this passage portrays the Spirit of Adoption as the counterforce to the spirit of fear.  When fear tries to pull on your heart, you have the right to cry out, “Abba Father,” through CHRIST JESUS!  When you cry out, “ABBA FATHER,” you have the full assurance that the FATHER hears you.  From Galatians 4:6, we know that the Spirit of Adoption is in fact the Spirit of CHRIST within you, crying out “ABBA FATHER.”  The spirit of fear will always produce torment in your life, if you allow it. If you yield instead to the Spirit of Adoption, the result will be power, love, and a sound mind!</p>
								
								<h2><i>Opening Scripture</i></h2>
								<blockquote>For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father.”&#8212;Romans 8:15[NKJV]</blockquote>
								
								<h2>Discuss</h2>
								<ol>
									<li>Read the Opening Scripture <strong>Romans 8:15</strong>. Describe why the Spirit of Adoption and the spirit of fear are opposite forces.</li>
									<li>Read <strong>1 John4:18</strong>. Describe how HIS perfect Love drives out fear in our lives.</li>
									<li>Read <strong>Hebrews 2:14-15</strong>. In these verses, we find that JESUS has released us from bondage to the fear of death.  What does this truth mean to us as believers?</li>
									<li>Read <strong>Psalm 112:7</strong>. The New Living Translation for this verse says “They do not fear bad news; they confidently trust the LORD to care for them.” How do we come to a place where this a reality in our lives (that we can live without any fear of bad reports)?</li>
									<li>Read <strong>II Timothy 1:7</strong>. Often we emphasize the first half of the verse, that GOD has not given us a spirit of fear.  But now, let’s consider the rest of the verse.  Let’s examine what <strong>HE</strong> has given us!  What does a life of power, love, and soundness of mind look like? How can we begin to walk in power, love, and soundness of mind?</li>
								
								</ol>
								
								
								
															
								<h2>Invitation</h2>
								<blockquote>If you have dealt with any degree of fear in your life, now is the time to release it to the LORD, allowing HIM to redefine your expectations through HIS infinite Love.  Let us pray with you!</blockquote>
