								<h2><i>Today's Scripture</i></h2>
								<blockquote>Therefore I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little -Luke 7:47</blockquote>
								
								<p>Let's look at Luke 7:36-50 to see what Jesus said about the forgiveness of sins. Simon, a Pharisee, had invited Jesus to his house. While Jesus was seated at the table in Simon's house, a woman came to Him. She began to weep and she washed His feet with her tears. Then, she wiped His feet with her hair, kissed them and anointed them with fragrant oil.</p>
								
								<h3>You will only love Jesus much when you experience His lavish grace and unmerited favor<br />in forgiving you of all your sins&minus;past, present, and future.</h3>
								
								<p>When Simon saw this, he said to himself, "This Man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what manner of woman this is who is touching Him, for she is a sinner." Even though Simon did not speak aloud, it it interesting that Jesus answered him by posing this question to him: "There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. And when they had nothing with which to repay, he <strong>freely forgave them</strong> both. Tell Me, therefore, which of them will love him more?" Simon answered, "I suppose the one whom he forgave more." Jesus said to him, "You have rightly judged."</p>
								
								<p>Then, Jesus turned to the womand and said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has washed My feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head. You gave Me no kiss, but this woman has not ceased to kiss My feet since the time I came in. You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with fragrant oil. Therefore I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little."</p>
								
								<p>The woman loved Jesus <strong>much</strong> because she <strong>knew</strong> that she was <strong>forgiven much</strong>. In actuality, no one has been forgiven little. We have all been forgiven much. As for this woman, she knew it. So the most "dangerous" thing about this doctrine of complete forgiveness of sins is that you will fall in love with Jesus and end up effortlessly fulfilling the greatest commandement: "You shall love the Lord with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind" (Matthew 22:36-38). Hallelujah!</p>
								
								<p>If you <strong>think</strong> that you have been forgiven little, then you will love little. But when you <strong>know</strong> the truth of how much you have been forgiven, you will love Jesus much! Knowing how much you have been forgiven is the secret to loving Jesus much! In other words, you will only love Jesus much when you experience His lavish grace and unmerited favor in forgiving you of all your sins-past, present, future. But His grace is cheapened when you think that He has only forgiven you of your sins up to the time you got saved, and after that point, you have to depend on your confession of sins to be forgiven.</p>
								
								<p>God's forgiveness is not given in installments. Don't go around thinking that when you confess a sin, He forgives you only for that sin. Then, the next time you sin, you need to confess your sin again for Him to forgive you again. Such is the kind of belief that cheapens His grace. And the result of this is that because you think that He has forgiven you little, you will end up loving Him little, and deprive yourself of running to Him and seeing Him help, deliver, and prosper you.</p>
								
								<p>Beloved, with one sacrafice on the cross, Jesus blotted out all the sins of your entire life! Don't cheapen His unmerited favor with your own imperfect efforts to confess all your sins. Accord this gift that Jesus has given you the value that it deserves by fully receiving and experiencing His unmerited favor today!</p>
								
															
								<h2><i>Today's Prayer</i></h2>
								<blockquote>Father, I thank You that I am forgiven much. In fact, all my sins of my entire life have been forgiven, wiped out once and for all by the eternal blood of Jesus. Therefore, today, I look forwared to receiving Your unmerited favor and every good thing You have sent my way!</blockquote>
								
								<h2>Today's Thought</h2>
								<blockquote>Knowing how much I have been forigven is the secret to loving Jesus much.</blockquote>
