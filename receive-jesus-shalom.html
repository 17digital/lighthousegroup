								<h2><i>Today's Scripture</i></h2>
								<blockquote>A heart of Peace gives life to the body... -Proverbs 14:30 NIV</blockquote>
								
								<p>The BEST WAY to know if you are embroiled in the things of the world is to be objective and ask yourself this: "Is my heart troubled?" I 
								believe that the number one killer in the modern world is <strong>stress.</strong> Medical doctors in my church have told me that if a patient has high blood pressure, they can advise the patient to cut down on sodium. They can also advise their patients to cut down on other exesses such as sugar or cholesterol. But as doctors, there is one thing they cannot control in their patients, and that is their patients' stress levels.</p>
								
								<h3>Stress is not from God. Peace is from Him!</h3>
								
								<p>I personally believe that the physical root cause of many medical conditions today is stress. Stress can produce all kinds of imbalances in your body. It can cause you to age prematurely, give you rashes, cause gastric pains and even lead to abnormal growths in your body. To put it succinctly, stress kills! Doctors tell us that certain physical symptoms are "psychosomatic" in nature. That's because these symptoms are brought about by psychological problems such as stress. Stress is not from God. <strong>Peace</strong> is from Him!</p>
								
								<p>I trust that your are beginning to understand why Jesus said, "Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid" (John 14:27). Now, Jesus would not have used the word "peace." The Greek New Testament renders "peace" as <i>eirene</i>, but since Jesus spoke Aramaic-Hebrew, He would have used the word "shalom" - "<strong>Shalom</strong> I leave with you, My <strong>Shalom</strong> I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you."</p>
								
								<p>In the Hebrew vernacular, "shalom" is a very rich and loaded word. There is no English word that can accurately encapsulate the fullness, richness, and power contained in the word "shalom." Hence, English Bible translators were only able to translate it as "peace." But while the word "shalom" includes peace, it means so much more. Let's look at the <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/resources/lexical/bdb.cfm" target="_blank">Brown Driver & Briggs Hebrew Lexicon</a> to get a better idea of what Jesus meant when He said, "Shalom I leave with you."</p>
								
								<p>The Hebrew Lexicon describes "shalom" as <strong>completeness, safety, soundness (in body), welfare, health, prosperity, peace, quiet, tranquility, contentment, peace used of human relationships, peace with God especially in our covenant relationship, and peace from war.</strong> Wow, what a powerful word! This is the shalom that Jesus has bequeathed you: His completeness, His safety, His soundness, His welfare, His Health, His prosperity, His peace, His quietness, His tranquility, His contentment, His peace in human relationships, His peace with God through the covenant made at the cross and His peace from war. All these, my friend, are part of your inheritance in Christ today!</p>
								
								<p>Can you picture the full implications of what it means to experience Jesus' shalom in your life? Can you picture your life being free from regrets, anxieties, and worries? How healthy, vibrant, energetic, and strong you will be! Thank Him for this blessing today and start enjoying Jesus' shalom in every area of your life.</p>
								
								<h2><i>Today's Prayer</i></h2>
								<blockquote>Lord Jesus, thank You for giving me Your shalom in every area of my life. I want to experience and walk in a greater measure of Your shalom. I want to live a life that is free of regrets, anxieties, and worries, and experience more of Your health, energy, and strength. Today because I have your shalom, I will walk in Your peace, prosperity, and protection as I deal with the demands of this day.</blockquote>
								
								<h2>Today's Thought</h2>
								<blockquote>Less Stress plus more of Jesus' shalom equals more health.</blockquote>
